# Investment Group Project – ESG Portfolio Construction

This repository contains the notebook **Investment_Group_Project.ipynb**, which implements a quantitative portfolio construction and analysis framework for ESG-related investment groups.

The notebook focuses on applying portfolio theory and statistical analysis to compare portfolio characteristics across different ESG-based asset groups.

---

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to explore how **portfolio construction outcomes differ when the investment universe is restricted by ESG-related criteria**.

Using historical market data, the notebook:
- Constructs portfolios from different ESG groups
- Applies standard portfolio optimization techniques
- Evaluates and compares portfolio risk-return characteristics

The project is structured as a **research-oriented notebook**, emphasizing methodology, analysis, and interpretability.

## Notebook Contents

The notebook includes the following major components:

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Importing and cleaning historical price data
   - Organizing assets into ESG-based groups

2. **Return and Risk Estimation**
   - Computing asset returns
   - Estimating expected returns
   - Estimating covariance matrices

3. **Portfolio Construction**
   - Applying portfolio optimization methods such as:
     - Minimum Variance Portfolio
     - Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio
   - Enforcing basic constraints (e.g., long-only)

4. **Performance Evaluation**
   - Expected return
   - Volatility
   - Sharpe ratio
   - Comparative analysis across investment groups

5. **Visualization**
   - Portfolio weight distributions
   - Summary statistics and plots

## Methodology

The analysis follows a standard mean–variance portfolio construction framework:

- Asset returns are estimated from historical data
- Portfolio optimization is performed under explicit objective functions
- Resulting portfolios are evaluated using risk-adjusted performance metrics

This allows for a systematic comparison of portfolio behavior across different ESG investment universes.
